<h1> Edit Rule Dialog</h1>

<h2>Rule properties</h2>

<p>This dialog lets you modify the properties of an autopin rule.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Description</b><br>
    This can be anything you want. It will be displayed in the rules list of the <a href="optautopin.htm">Autopin options</a>
    page.</li>
  <li><b>Title</b> / <b>Class</b><br>
    The title and class of the window to pin. For more information, see <a href="autopinningwnd.htm">Auto-pinning windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Title and Class fields have a little <b>target icon</b> to their right
side, which you can use to retrieve the corresponding attributes of any window.
This saves you the trouble from typing the window title and allows you to read its class name (the latter being only possible by using special software).
Just grab one of them with the mouse and drag it over the window of interest.
While dragging the target icon, the corresponding text field will be constantly updated
and the
border around the targeted window will flash. When you get the information from the
desired window, release the mouse button. You can then edit the text field, if
you want, in order to add wildcards.</p>
