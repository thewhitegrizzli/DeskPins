<h1>Autopin Options</h1>
<h2>Autopin settings</h2>
<p>This page configures the Autopin feature. You can learn more about it in <a href="autopinningwnd.htm">Auto-pinning windows</a>.</p>

<p><b>Enable</b><br>
Check this to enable Autopin and allow the other options to be edited.</p>
<p><b>Rules</b><br>
This list contains all the configured rules. Each rule can be specifically
enabled or disabled by checking or clearing the tick box on its left. You can
add a new rule by clicking the <b>Add...</b> button and remove any of them using
the <b>Remove</b> button. To edit a rule, double-click on it or click the <b>Edit...</b>
button. This will bring up the <a href="editruledlg.htm">Edit Rule dialog</a>.
Finally, you can use the <b>Move Up</b> and <b>Move Down</b> buttons to reorder
the rules (although their relative order doesn't affect their functionality).</p>
<p><b>Delay</b><br>
This controls how long DeskPins will wait before checking the Autopin rules on a
newly created window. This is necessary for rules that depend on window titles, because some
windows are first created with a generic title which they change before they're
shown. The default value is 200 msec. If you notice that some rules are not
working, you may try increasing this value.</p>
