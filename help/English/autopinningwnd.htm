<h1>Auto-Pinning Windows</h1>
<p>You can configure DeskPins to automatically pin certain windows as soon as
they are created. This should be useful in case you always want to make an
application topmost (e.g. Calculator, console windows, etc).</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>You can specify which windows will be auto-pinned by adding auto-pin rules
(see <a href="optautopin.htm">Autopin options</a>). Every time a window is created, DeskPins will check whether it satisfies any
rules, and if so, it will pin it. A rule consists of two parameters: a <b> title</b> and a
<b>class</b>, which are explained below.
Both parameters can contain DOS-style wildcards (* and ?) and they are <i>not</i>
case sensitive.</p>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>The window title is usually displayed on its caption. Applications also
display the title of their main window on the taskbar. The title may contain
more than just the application name; for example, many programs also display a document name.</p>
<p>When you create a rule based on the window title, you should try to specify
the part of the title that stays the same. An example may help: Suppose you
would like to create a rule for Notepad. The window's title will be
&quot;Untitled&nbsp;-&nbsp;Notepad&quot; if no file is open, or &quot;<i>some
file name</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Notepad&quot; otherwise. To make sure that both cases
are covered, you should mask out the variable part and only keep the part that's
always the same. So, you could use something like &quot;*&nbsp;-&nbsp;Notepad&quot;,
where the * wildcard represents any possible combination of characters.</p>
<h3>Class</h3>
<p>The window class is essentially its type. It is specified when a window is
created and remains unchanged until its removal. It is used mainly by
application developers; most end users need not worry about it. However, because
of its persistence, the window class can be used to easily identify windows. For example, all Notepad windows have a class name of
&quot;Notepad&quot;. So, another way to detect these windows would be to specify
their class name, without worrying about the title, since only Notepad windows
will be of class &quot;Notepad&quot;. However, using both the class name <i> and</i> the
window title (wherever possible) is considered best practice.</p>
<p>Some examples of class names are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>CabinetWClass</i>: Explorer folder windows</li>
  <li><i>ConsoleWindowClass</i>: Console windows</li>
  <li><i>MSPaintApp</i>: the Windows Paint utility</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="editruledlg.htm">Edit Rule dialog</a>
provides a simple way to read the title and class of any window by using the
mouse.</p>
<h3>Delay</h3>
<p>Although the class name is invariable during the lifetime of a window, its
title is not. To make things worse, the title usually changes after the window
is created but before it is shown, making it impossible to see the original
title. To overcome this, DeskPins lets you specify a
delay after the creation of a window, to allow for any changes to take place.
This delay is measured in milliseconds and applies for all the rules. You can
set this delay, along with the auto-pin rules in the <a href="optautopin.htm">Autopin options</a>
page.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Try to be as specific as possible when defining rules. Also, try to use both a
    window title <i> and</i> a class when possible.</li>
  <li>Use a single asterisk (*) to match any text. Leaving a field empty will
    only match an empty title or class. Note, however, that a window class cannot be
    empty.</li>
  <li>Don't rely on the class of dialog windows being unique. Almost all dialog
    boxes in all applications have the same class (&quot;#32770&quot;). If you
    must make a rule depending on a dialog box, you should also use the dialog
    title.</li>
</ul>
